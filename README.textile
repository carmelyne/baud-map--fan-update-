h1. Baud Map Fan Update

Welcome to Baud Map Fan Update! This is a fan update of Baud Map originally by "Baudzilla":http://gw.cn.curse.com/members/Baudzila.aspx

h2. Project Info

Shows your friends on the minimap in green so you can see them easy, and adds player names to the world map. Also adds bases and graveyards to the minimap for Alterac Valley and Arathi Basin (Blizzard already does this for the other maps).

Note: Baud Map will not work inside instances, since the world map doesn't work inside them.
